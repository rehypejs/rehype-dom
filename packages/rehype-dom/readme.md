## What is this?

This is like [`rehype`][rehype] but for browsers.

## When should I use this?

Use this package when you want to use `rehype` in browsers.
See [the monorepo readme][rehype-dom] for info on when to use `rehype-dom`.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import {rehypeDom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom@6?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {rehypeDom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom@6?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our page `example.html` looks as follows:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import {rehypeDom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom@6?min'

  const file = await rehypeDom().process('<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>')

  document.body.innerHTML = String(file)
</script>
```

Now running `open example.html` renders the following in `<body>`:

```html
<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>
```

## API

This package exports the following identifier: `rehypeDom`.
There is no default export.

### `rehypeDom()`

Create a new (unfrozen) `unified` processor that already uses `rehype-dom-parse`
and `rehype-dom-stringify` and you can add more plugins to.
See [`unified`][unified] for more information.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the default of the `fragment` option is `true` in this package,
> which is different from the value in `rehype`, because it makes more sense in
> browsers.

## Examples

### Example: passing options

When you use `remark-dom-parse` and `remark-dom-stringify` manually you can pass
options to `use`.
Because these are already used in `rehype-dom`, thatâ€™s not possible.
To define options for them, you can instead pass options to `data`:

```js
import {rehypeDom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom@6?min'

const file = await rehypeDom()
  .data('settings', {fragment: false})
  .process('<!doctype html>' + document.documentElement.outerHTML)

console.log(String(file))
```

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
There are no extra exported types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if the result is used with the actual DOM.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to solve that.
