## What is this?

This is like [`rehype-parse`][rehype-parse] but for browsers.
This plugin uses DOM APIs to do its work, which makes it smaller in browsers, at
the cost of not supporting positional info on nodes.

## When should I use this?

Use this package when you want to use `rehype-parse` solely in browsers.
See [the monorepo readme][rehype-dom] for info on when to use `rehype-dom`.

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-from-dom`][hast-util-from-dom], which is a
low level tool to turn DOM nodes into hast syntax trees.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom-parse
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeDomParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-parse@4?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeDomParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-parse@4?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our page `example.html` looks as follows:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import {unified} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/unified@10?min'
  import rehypeDomParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-parse@4?min'
  import rehypeRemark from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-remark@8?min'
  import remarkStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-stringify@10?min'

  const file = await unified()
    .use(rehypeDomParse)
    .use(rehypeRemark)
    .use(remarkStringify)
    .process(`<h1>Hi</h1>
<p><em>Hello</em>, world!</p>`)

  console.log(String(file))
</script>
```

Now running `open example.html` prints the following to the console:

```markdown
# Hi

*Hello*, world!
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeDomParse`.

### `unified.use(rehypeDomParse[, options])`

Add support for parsing HTML input.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.fragment`

Specify whether to parse a fragment (`boolean`, default: `true`), instead of a
complete document.
In document mode, unopened `html`, `head`, and `body` elements are opened in
just the right places.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the default of the `fragment` option is `true` in this package,
> which is different from the value in `rehype-parse`, because it makes more
> sense in browsers.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
The extra type `Options` is exported.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom-parse` itself is safe but see `rehype`, `rehype-dom`, or
`rehype-dom-stringify` for more information on potential security problems.
