## What is this?

This is like [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify] but for browsers.
This plugin uses DOM APIs to do its work, which makes it smaller in browsers, at
the cost of not supporting formatting options.

## When should I use this?

Use this package when you want to use `rehype-stringify` solely in browsers.
See [the monorepo readme][rehype-dom] for info on when to use `rehype-dom`.

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-to-dom`][hast-util-to-dom], which is a low
level tool to turn hast syntax trees into DOM nodes.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-dom-stringify
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-stringify@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-stringify@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our page `example.html` looks as follows:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import {unified} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/unified@10?min'
  import remarkParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-parse@10?min'
  import remarkRehype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-rehype@10?min'
  import rehypeDomStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom-stringify@3?min'

  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypeDomStringify)
    .process('# Hello, world!')

  console.log(String(file))
</script>
```

Now running `open example.html` prints the following to the console:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeDomStringify`.

### `unified().use(rehypeDomStringify[, options])`

Add support for serializing HTML.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.fragment`

Specify whether to serialize a fragment (`boolean`, default: `true`), instead of
a complete document.
In document mode, an `html` element is added when needed.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the default of the `fragment` option is `true` in this package,
> which is different from the value in `rehype-stringify`, because it makes more
> sense in browsers.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
The extra type `Options` is exported.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom-stringify` can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack if the result is used with the actual
DOM.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to solve that.
