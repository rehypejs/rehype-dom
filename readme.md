This project is a monorepo that contains alternatives to [rehype][] for use in
browsers.

## What is this?

This monorepo contains the following packages:

*   [`rehype-dom-parse`][rehype-dom-parse]
    — plugin to take HTML as input and turn it into a syntax tree (hast) in
    browsers
*   [`rehype-dom-stringify`][rehype-dom-stringify]
    — plugin to take a syntax tree (hast) and turn it into HTML as output in
    browsers
*   [`rehype-dom`][api]
    — `unified`, `rehype-dom-parse`, and `rehype-dom-stringify`, useful when
    input and output are HTML

## When should I use this?

You can use this project when you want to use rehype in browsers.
It has a smaller footprint in browsers compared to `rehype` itself as it uses
DOM APIs to do its work.
However, DOM APIs:

*   …cannot provide positional information (each node knowing where it
    originated), which is frequently needed when working with rehype
*   …do not have formatting options that `rehype-stringify` exposes
*   …can provide varying results in different (especially older) browsers
*   …are safe, but untrusted HTML in browsers is always unsafe

## Example

Say our page `example.html` looks as follows:

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>Example</title>
<body>
<script type="module">
  import {rehypeDom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-dom@6?min'

  const file = await rehypeDom().process('<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>')

  document.body.innerHTML = String(file)
</script>
```

Now running `open example.html` renders the following in `<body>`:

```html
<h1>Hi <del>Mars</del>Venus!</h1>
```

## Security

Use of `rehype-dom` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if the document is unsafe or unsafe plugins are used.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.
